\section{Internship organisation}
	\subsection{Introduction}

This section is meant to be added to the University version of this documentation. It will be written as Erwan Ulrich and will focus on the different aspects of the organisation of the project. The folllowing text will also be written with a more personnal and more critical point of view as a mean of self analysement.

	\subsection{Calendars}
	
The	SchemaFuzz project has had since its genesis a quiet clear view of how the development should evolve. The desired features have been discussed and the big picture had been designed to fit the time that the main developer had for his work at this position.
The project had to pass trough different phases of development that are detailed in the following timeline diagram. %% insert timeline diagram here.

Some of the tasks of the above timeline were completed on time, some others were delivered late, and some were delayed in the timeline because of the previous point.
In the end, the project was lead in a way that is best described by the following timeline diagram.    %% insert timeline diagram here.

Those two diagrams differ on some points. This is one of the major failures for the development of this project throughout the course of these 6 months. 
There are several reasons that explain why this project could have been lead in a better way.
they will be detailled and discussed in the next section. 

	\subsection{Organisationnal failures}
This section has a particular value in this report, it is on the first hand a description of why the SchemaFuzz did not meet all of its defined goals.
Other the other hand, it is a personnal reminder of what should be improved in my work habbits and general organisation when leading a project of such a large size.
